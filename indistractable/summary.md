`TRACTION`: actions that draw us toward what we want in life.
`DISTRACTION` : Distractions impede us from making progress toward the life we envision

Researchers tell us
attention and focus are the raw materials of human creativity and
flourishing\*\*

Being indistractable means striving to do what
you say you will do.

Most people don’t want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that
distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality

**If distraction costs us time, then time
management is pain management.**

### Four psychological factors make satisfaction temporary:

1. Boredom
2. Negativity bias (bad is stronger than good)
3. Rumination (tendency to think about bad experiences)
4. Hedonic adaptation

Dissatisfaction and discomfort dominate our
brain’s default state, but we can use them to
motivate us instead of defeat us.

**It’s good to know that feeling bad isn’t actually
bad; it’s exactly what survival of the fittest
intended.**

### Leaf on the stream technique:

When feeling the uncomfortable internal trigger to do something
you’d rather not, “imagine you are seated beside a gently flowing
stream,” he says. “Then imagine there are leaves floating down that
stream. Place each thought in your mind on each leaf. It could be a
memory, a word, a worry, an image. And let each of those leaves float
down that stream, swirling away, as you sit and just watch.

### 10 minute rule

If I find myself wanting to check
my phone as a pacification device when I can’t think of anything better
to do, I tell myself it’s fine to give in, but not right now. I have to wait
just ten minutes. This technique is effective at helping me deal with all
sorts of potential distractions, like googling something rather than
writing, eating something unhealthy when I’m bored, or watching
another episode on Netflix when I’m “too tired to go to bed.”

It’s a curious truth
that when you gently pay attention to negative emotions, they tend to
dissipate—but positive ones expand.

`Fun and play don’t have to make us feel good per
se; rather, they can be used as tools to keep us
focused`

Labeling yourself as having poor self-control actually leads to less self-control.

We can reimagine the task we’re
trying to accomplish by looking for the fun in it and focusing on it more
intensely.

Timeboxing uses a well-researched technique
psychologists call “setting an implementation intention,” which is a
fancy way of saying, “deciding what you’re going to do, and when
you’re going to do it.” It’s a technique that can be used to make time for
traction in each of your life domains.

when it comes to our time, we
should stop worrying about outcomes we can’t control and instead focus
on the inputs we can.

Today, much of our struggle with distraction is a
struggle with external triggers like `social media`

Removing unhelpful external triggers is a simple step toward
controlling unwanted distractions

**You’d be amazed how many things become
irrelevant when you give them a little time to
breathe.**

If we are going to spend our time in a meeting, we
must make sure that we are present, both in body
and mind.

“Less distraction; more time to focus,”

**Personally, I still use Facebook, but now I use it the way I want
instead of the way Facebook intended.**

Focus not only requires keeping distraction out; it also necessitates keeping ourselves in

An ef ort pact prevents distraction by making
unwanted behaviors more dif icult to do.
